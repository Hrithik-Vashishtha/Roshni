Introduction: 
In 2020, amid the Covid lockdown, my fascination with chess took root, and since then, it's become a daily pursuit. An event hosted by Chessbase India opened my eyes to visually impaired chess players and sparked a determination within me to contribute something meaningful. Thus, the project Roshni was bornâ€”a chess assistant tailored specifically for visually impaired players.

Working:
Roshni operates by allowing players to vocalize their moves, utilizing speech recognition to translate their spoken moves into actions on the board. The second move is executed by a chess bot, and the subsequent move's announcement is conveyed through text-to-speech functionality. After each move, an updated board is displayed for the audience's benefit. This innovative solution accommodates players who may lack the ability to physically move the pieces. Additionally, it offers customizable features such as setting the opponent's Elo rating or adjusting the game's depth. Player can analyse his game later with the help of the database.


Next Steps:
Currently, the architectural groundwork has been laid. The next phase involves use of NLP techniques for the accurate input of the moves..
